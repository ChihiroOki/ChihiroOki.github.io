## Takoyaki craftsman and design patterns

   It was when I was working part-time at a takoyaki restaurant.
   The first time I was assigned to be the chef, I poured the dough, added the octopus, and somehow rolled it out just as I saw fit.

   The finished takoyaki is well, not inedible. But something is clearly different from the takoyaki cooked by boss.
   The outside is not crispy and the timing of turning it over is uneven.

    It was frustrating
    There is a pattern," the boss said. There is a certain way of doing takoyaki," he said. It's a design pattern for takoyaki.
    At that time, I still did not know the true meaning of the term “design pattern,” but it stuck with me.
    Years later, when I began to learn programming, I came across the term again.
    A design pattern is a “reusable solution to a common problem” created in the field of software development.
    In other words, they are like “how to cook takoyaki” that veteran engineers have developed through years of trial and error.
    For example, the “Singleton” pattern. This is used when you want only one instance to exist. 
    It's like “I only need one bottle of soy sauce.” In fact, I have used singletons in my bike management application to store settings and user information. 
    By always using the same instance, data consistency was maintained.
    In addition, the “Observer” pattern and the “Factory” pattern were used naturally in React and Next.js development. 
    It was precisely because of these patterns that the screen was re-rendered every time the input values of the form changed, or that different parts were generated from a common interface.
    The funny thing is that even without knowing the design patterns, we think similarly on a daily basis. 
    The same was true of my senior's “grilling method.
    A design pattern is a “pattern of wisdom” created by the accumulation of rules of thumb.
    So, if I am asked in an interview, "Do you know what a design pattern is? I might answer as follows.
    And my code has such a “baking method” engraved in it.
