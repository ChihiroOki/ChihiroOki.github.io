## Connection with JavaScript and TypeScript.

JavaScript	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                TypeScript<br>

No interfaces or enums	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          ‚úÖ Interfaces, Enums, Type Aliases<br>
No compile-time checks	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       üß† Compile-time error checking<br>
Poor tooling for large projects	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   üß∞ Autocomplete, refactoring, and IDE support<br>
Loosely structured	           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     üèóÔ∏è Classes with access modifiers (public, private, protected)<br>

## WODs

Athletic software engineering requires a high level of accuracy, deep knowledge, and strong problem-solving skills. There isn‚Äôt just one way to approach a problem and reach a solution. That‚Äôs why practicing WODs (Workouts of the Day) is so valuable‚Äînot only for athletic software engineering but also for programming in general.

What I like about the WOD style is that it allows me to focus on small programs while using a timer, which I find to be a very effective learning method. It helps me stay focused and build confidence through repetition.

At the same time, working on WODs can be stressful for me because even small problems can be very challenging. However, I believe that once I get used to doing WODs regularly, they will definitely become a powerful part of my learning routine.



## How I felt about learning Type Script

Learning type script is really important I feel. However, it is really hard for me to learn quiclly, so I need more time to master this laungage. I also think JavaScript is really important to learn TypeScript because grammar and how to code is simmilar and connected to TypeScript.
