## Connection with JavaScript and TypeScript.

JavaScript	                          TypeScript 
Dynamically typed	                   🔒 Statically typed variables, parameters
No interfaces or enums	             ✅ Interfaces, Enums, Type Aliases
No compile-time checks	             🧠 Compile-time error checking
Poor tooling for large projects	     🧰 Autocomplete, refactoring, and IDE support
Loosely structured	                 🏗️ Classes with access modifiers (public, private, protected)
