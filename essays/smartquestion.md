*We have learned the hard way that without such a notice, we will repeatedly be pestered by idiots who think having published this document makes it our job to solve all the world's technical problems.*

According to Eric Steven Raymond essay, in the internet world, how u ask questions actually makes difference to the quality of the answer. 
The hackers is nice to people who tried to research deeply before asking questions, or people who tried to find the answer. 
In his essay, he introduces preparation and techenicsto get great quality answer. It is important to respect volunteer's time and show them respect by shaping your questions smart.
However, as I just read this, I did not even understand what is smart questions.
Then, Let's go stackOverflow and let's look for the great quality questions and answer and bad examples too!<br>
‚úÖ What to look for in a ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù (Good) Question on StackOverflow„ÄÄ<br>
üîπ Clear and specific title <br>
‚Üí Example: ‚ÄúWhy does my async function return 'undefined' in JavaScript?‚Äù<br>

üîπ Provides background or context of the problem<br>
‚Üí Explains the goal or situation that led to the issue<br>

üîπ Shows evidence of prior research or attempted solutions<br>
‚Üí Example: ‚ÄúI tried using await, but it still returns undefined.‚Äù<br>

üîπ Includes a Minimal, Reproducible Example<br>
‚Üí A short code snippet that can actually be tested<br>

üîπ Clearly describes both the expected and actual results<br>

üîπ Uses polite and professional language<br>

üîπ Received accurate and thoughtful answers; the questioner responds appreciatively<br>

‚ùå What to look for in a ‚ÄúNot Smart‚Äù (Bad) Question on StackOverflow<br>
‚ö†Ô∏è Vague or unclear title<br>
‚Üí Example: ‚ÄúHelp!! It doesn‚Äôt work!!!‚Äù<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è Poor grammar or messy formatting<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è No code provided, or includes a long, unreadable code dump<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è Little to no explanation of the problem<br>
‚Üí For example: ‚ÄúI get an error. Please help.‚Äù<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è Emotion-based language instead of technical detail<br>
‚Üí Example: ‚ÄúPlease help me fast! I'm a beginner!‚Äù<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è No sign of prior effort or independent troubleshooting<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è Comments from others are critical or frustrated<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è The question has been downvoted or closed by moderators<br>

## 1st example

In the context of programming, this has always been true. The difficult problems have always been different, although changes in technology can change the landscape quite a bit. "Business" type applications are the things that come to mind for me. Those types of applications are usually coupled in some way with people ... and people are awfully hard to deal with!

Consider that one of the most popular content management systems is also considered the most horrible - Wordpress. But really, is there anything that fills that need? If it was so easy in the first place, where is the solution? Where's the magic CMS that is designed well enough that everyone hops on the boat to use it?

Some things are just difficult - building applications that humans use is hard, and will probably be hard for at least the near future.

## 2nd example

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## Diferrence

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Summury

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
